# ✈️ Customer Insights & Predictive Analytics for Airline Bookings
Hey there! This repository showcases the results of my analytical study on airline customer reviews and booking behaviors. The main objective of this project is to derive meaningful insights from customer feedback and build a predictive model to enhance the understanding of booking trends.
## 🚀 Project Overview
### Objectives:
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, anomalies, and key indicators from customer interactions.

💬 Sentiment Analysis using NLP techniques to assess customer satisfaction based on reviews.

🤖 Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict booking completion likelihood based on customer and booking features.

### 🧰 Tools Used
Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

NLTK / VADER (Sentiment Analysis)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub (Version Control)

### 🧠 Knowledge Gained
✔️ Gained hands-on experience in customer sentiment analysis within the aviation industry. ✔️ Improved proficiency in data preprocessing, visualization, and NLP techniques. ✔️ Applied classification models in a business context to inform strategy. ✔️ Enhanced ability to communicate insights effectively through reports and visualizations.

### 📌 What's Next
🔧 Optimize the ML model through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. 📊 Compare different classifiers (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.) for performance evaluation. 📡 Develop a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash to visualize real-time insights (stretch goal 🚀).
